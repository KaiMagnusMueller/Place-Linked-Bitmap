# Place Linked Bitmap
## How to use


###Project Folder

This plugin uses relative paths to link each image and reconstructs the complete path when executed. This allows for greater flexibility when working in teams. Files can be placed on a dropbox and multiple persons can work on a file 

#####Place Bitmap as New Layer...

Use this command to select an image and place it in your Sketch file as an image layer. If this is the first updateable image in your file, you will be prompted to select a project folder. (Be carefuil about the dialogue title)

#####Place Bitmap as fill Layer...

Identical to as New Layer with the exception a layer has to be selected when this function is used. An image fill then gets applied to the selected layer. 

#####Update all Bitmaps

Looks for changes in all linked files and updates them. 


#####Change folder

Should you move your project folder, use this function to select a new root folder. Otherwise the plugin will not be able to locate the previously placed images.
